# Stray-Cause we Care
I witness various local stray animals especially dogs, wandering about in a  miserable conition. Most of them were badly injured and lack basic care necessary for their survival, people like me want to contribute something towards their wellness, but are not sure where to begin with. So, here I am trying to build an interface to connect the various dog ngos to the local people who really wants to help the needy by deploying an appplication which will be called Stray.
